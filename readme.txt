Not your regular chatbot. 

== Description ==

Not your regular chatbot - this one uses javascript state machines to create a "guided tour" chatbot for your site, a chatbot that can guide your users to valuable information and resources on your site - and no AI hallucinations or broken promises that you can't fulfil as your AI model has made a mistake. 

All your data is stored on-site, no third party has access to it and you control what users see.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to your site, activate it, and then add some DuweWP ChatBot Screens. Once that's done, go to Settings -> DuweWP ChatBot Options and select your defaults to display it on your site.
